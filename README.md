# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data
Description: I performed sentiment analysis over twitter data related to the war in Ukraine to find out trends and aggregates in the public's feelings on the subject. The main tools I used were GCP products, namely BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage, VertexAI, and Looker Studio. I also used Python and Jupyter to clean the data and explore it.
